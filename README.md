Minium wants to have a social live!

So youâ€™ll have to teach him how to manage his social network, for instance, Facebook or Twitter.

Examples of what you can program Minium to do:
<ul>
<li>Reply to posts (you can use any online chat bot for the task), even in other languages than english (you can use google translator)</li>
<li>Add contents to its wall (news, memes, videos, you decide)</li>
<li>Accept friend requests</li>
<li>Congratulate friends for a new achievement or birthday</li>
<li>Pass Turing Test</li>
<li>In the best case scenario you can drive a "Social Media Manager" out of work ! </li>
</ul>


<strong>Submission: </strong> Submit your code, some screenshots or video of Minium in action is also a plus to the email minium@vilt-group.com with SEIUM as the subject. Don't forget to adde your details: name, student number and contact.

<strong>Reward: </strong>The reward for the most creative solution is a <strong>Google Chromecast !</strong>
